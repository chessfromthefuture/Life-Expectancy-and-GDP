11. Introduction
12. Economic growth and public health are closely linked. This project aims to explore how GDP influences life expectancy, identify trends over time, and assess whether economic prosperity translates to better health outcomes.

Objectives
Analyze trends in life expectancy over time for six nations.  
Investigate GDP growth patterns for these nations.  
Assess the correlation between GDP and life expectancy.  
Calculate average life expectancy across the nations.  
Explore the distribution of life expectancy values.  
Data Description  
The dataset contains the following columns:  

Country: Name of the country.  
Year: Year of observation.
Life expectancy at birth (years): Average life expectancy at birth.
GDP: Gross Domestic Product in USD.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn: For creating visualizations.
Matplotlib: For plotting graphs and charts.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Methodology
Data Cleaning:

Checked for and handled missing or inconsistent values.
Ensured data types were correctly formatted.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Visualized trends and distributions using line plots, scatterplots, and histograms.
Calculated statistical measures like correlation coefficients and averages.
Insights Extraction:

Answered specific questions about trends, correlations, and distributions.
Key Findings
Life Expectancy Trends:
Increased over time in all six nations.
GDP Trends:
Most nations showed consistent GDP growth over time.
Correlation:
A positive correlation was observed between GDP and life expectancy.
Average Life Expectancy:
Varied across nations, with higher GDP nations generally having longer life expectancies.
Distribution:
Life expectancy values clustered around global averages, with some outliers.
Conclusions
Economic prosperity, as indicated by GDP, is strongly associated with higher life expectancy.
Policies promoting economic growth alongside healthcare investments can significantly improve public health outcomes.
Future Scope
Include more countries to generalize findings globally.
Analyze other factors like education, healthcare spending, and governance.
Use machine learning models to predict life expectancy based on GDP and other variables.
